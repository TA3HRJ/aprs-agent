# Findings log

A running record of what the software got wrong, how it was found, and what it
earned. Kept because the same lesson arrived twice from different directions
before anyone wrote it down.

Entries are appended, never rewritten. A finding that turns out to be mistaken
gets a correction line, not a deletion — see F-2026-08-12-07 for why.

## How a finding gets made

Most of these came from one method, which is worth stating because it works
better than reading the code:

1. Export the evidence bundle for something interesting — a silence cell, a
   propagation link — using the ⬇ / 📋 actions on its popup.
2. Paste it into an AI that has never seen this project.
3. Read the answer looking for **one** thing: where did it go wrong?
4. Ask the only question that matters:

   > Is this the model's fault, or the file's fault?

A model that reasons badly from good data is the model's problem, and there is
nothing to do. A model that invents something because the file did not tell it
is **the file's problem**, and that is a product improvement waiting to be
written down.

Two refinements learned the hard way:

- **Vary the model, and prefer one that is not related to the model that wrote
  `assessment.note`.** DeepSeek read a note written by deepseek-v4-flash and
  repeated its unverified claim. Gemini, unrelated, invented its own errors
  instead of inheriting ours — less flattering, more informative.
- **Run it blind first.** Delete the `assessment` block before pasting, so the
  model reaches its own conclusion before seeing ours. Then show it the note
  and see whether it moves. If it moves toward a note that was wrong, the note
  is anchoring readers rather than informing them, and you have just measured
  the damage.

### F-2026-08-12-01 — the AI note asserts simultaneity it never checked
**Source:** DeepSeek, silence cell JN28 (France) · **Verdict:** our fault

The generated note read *"Multiple igates and a digi went silent
**simultaneously**, suggesting a regional infrastructure or power outage."* The
per-station figures in the same bundle:

| station | silent for |
|---|---|
| F4LCL-13 | 42 min |
| F4MES-R | 3.4 h |
| F4MES-B | 3.4 h |
| F4BNZ-9 | 4.2 h |
| F4DYK | 11.4 h |

A power cut produces near-simultaneous onset. A spread from 42 minutes to 11
hours is the opposite signature. DeepSeek repeated "aynı anda" in its headline
while printing that table itself — it anchored on our word instead of its own
arithmetic.

**Earns:** the note should state the measured spread instead of claiming
simultaneity, and the spread belongs in the bundle as its own field
(`onset_spread_s`, or earliest/latest onset) so no reader can miss it.

### F-2026-08-12-02 — an unestablished gate baseline invites the opposite reading
**Source:** DeepSeek, propagation link HB9EM-10 → DJ8KL-2 · **Verdict:** our fault

The bundle reported `samples: 4, established: false, mean_km: 924.7,
sigma_km: 127.6`. DeepSeek reasoned from the mean anyway and concluded the gate
was built for long distances, so 701 km was normal for it — and raised its
confidence on that basis.

Both halves are wrong. With EMA alpha 0.05, four samples leave the mean
essentially at the first distance ever seen; it is not an average range. And if
701 km really were normal for that gate, that argues the link is *un*remarkable
— the opposite of what it was used for. The link was flagged precisely because
the gate has no usable baseline, so the absolute floor decided alone.

**Earns:** when `established` is false, say plainly that mean and sigma are not
meaningful yet and that the absolute floor made the decision. Handing over
numbers with only a quiet flag beside them is an invitation to misread.

### F-2026-08-12-03 — propagation thresholds have never been calibrated
**Source:** carried from the 2026-07 backlog · **Verdict:** open work, data now ready

`PROP_MIN_KM`, `PROP_MIN_SAMPLES = 20` and the `max(3*mean, mean+4*sigma)` rule
were set by judgement, with a note to calibrate once real data existed. It
exists now: 7278 links measured, 71 anomalous, 2476 gates with baselines, and a
full distance histogram.

The question to answer with it: **how many of the 71 anomalies came from gates
below the 20-sample threshold?** With 2476 gates, most cannot have 20 samples,
so the absolute-floor branch may be producing the bulk of the output. F-02 is
the same gap seen from the reader's side.

**Blocked on one missing field.** Gate baselines live in memory only, and
nothing is written down when a link is flagged, so the question cannot be
answered from what is stored today — only the histogram, the totals and the
recorded openings survive. The preparation is to record the gate's `samples`
and `established` on each anomalous link at the moment it is flagged. That
changes no behaviour; it only makes the count possible. Then wait a few days
and the answer falls out on its own.

### F-2026-08-12-04 — silence thresholds have never been calibrated either
**Source:** security audit, 2026-08-12 · **Verdict:** open work, data now ready

`min_silent = 3`, `min_ratio = 0.5` are untouched since they were written. In a
live sample, 11 of 41 alerting cells were 3–4 station cells, where "3 of 3
silent" can be one igate or one power strip. There are now 14 days of
`silence_history` to measure against.

## Closed

### F-2026-08-12-05 — a bundle with no history invites an invented history
**Source:** Gemini, silence cell FJ13 (Colombia) · **Verdict:** our fault
**Closed:** v3.2.5

Told after the fact that the station was the last one still down from a cluster
outage, Gemini abandoned a correct answer and manufactured support for the new
one: that the other six had recovered, that a quake had struck and the USGS feed
was lagging, that a mountain-top site had exhausted its batteries. None of it
was in the file. Its confidence rose from 90% to 85% for a conclusion with less
evidence behind it.

The operator's framing was right — FJ13 did reach 7 of 8 stations silent, and
that callsign appears in all 37 stored snapshots. The reader could not know,
because the bundle was a single frame. A file that cannot answer the first
question anyone asks invites the reader to answer it themselves.

**Fix:** `cell_history` — snapshot counts, the peak silent/baseline ever
reached, a recent series, and how often each callsign was named silent.
Confirmed working: the next external reader used it unprompted to spot two
gateways that were silent in 371 of 377 snapshots and discounted them.

### F-2026-08-12-06 — station "type" reads as fact when it is a symbol choice
**Source:** Gemini and DeepSeek both · **Verdict:** our fault
**Closed:** v3.2.7

`type: "rain-shower"` sent the first reading of a D-Star node toward "routine
automated weather station". The field is derived from the APRS symbol the
operator picked, not from the equipment.

**Fix:** stated in the caveats of both the silence and station bundles.

### F-2026-08-12-08 — a test that stubs the function under test proves nothing
**Source:** operator, propagation popup on the live map · **Verdict:** our fault
**Closed:** v3.2.9

"Copy as AI prompt" put nothing on the clipboard and showed no warning. The
endpoint was healthy — the same link returned 200 with a full bundle.

Chrome resolves `navigator.clipboard.write` even when the promise inside
`ClipboardItem` rejects. That resolution was being read as proof the copy had
happened, so a failed fetch produced *"Evidence copied"* with the clipboard
untouched — inviting a paste of whatever was there before. The same shape as
F-2026-08-12 v3.2.1: a failed copy passing as a successful one, arriving
through a different door.

The reason it survived a test pass is the part worth keeping. The v3.2.7 test
did this:

```js
window.propEvidence = function(c,g,t,p){ called = {...} };
links[1].click();
```

It stubbed the very function it was testing. It proved the button was wired to
*something* and nothing whatsoever about what the button does. Only the success
path was ever exercised end to end; the four failure branches had never run.

**Rule:** never stub the unit under test. Stub its boundaries — fetch, the
clipboard — and let the real code run. Enumerate the failure branches
explicitly: server error, network failure, permission refusal, synchronous
throw, success. All five are checked now, across the three exports that share
the exporter.

### F-2026-08-12-07 — a pip resolver error lists the constraints of versions it rejected
**Source:** building the 32-bit Windows release · **Verdict:** my own error, published
**Closed:** corrected in the v3.2.4 release notes, `requirements-build-win32.txt` and here

A pip backtracking log was read as the current dependency cap and written into
release notes as fact: that every `atproto` release requires
`cryptography<46`. It does not — 0.0.69 requires `>=41.0.7,<47`. The `<46` lines
came from *older* atproto versions pip was searching through because
cryptography 48 has no 32-bit Windows wheel.

**Rule:** check `importlib.metadata.requires()` or the PyPI `requires_dist` of
the *installed* version before quoting a constraint. A resolver error describes
the search, not the answer.

The published release notes carry a visible correction rather than a silent
edit, because quietly fixing it would hide that the wrong version was out
there.

## Not findings

Kept here so they stop being re-discovered:

- **Noise at a wide-net detector is not a bug.** Quake correlation deliberately
  reports anything within 500 km and 24 h and leaves the judging to a reader.
  Nine unrelated matches in one day is that design working. The defect was the
  map popup showing a magnitude and a distance with no time offset — the
  presentation layer, not the threshold.
- **A single long link is not an opening**, and no amount of plausibility
  changes that. Two distinct senders in one field is the finding.
